### System Prompt (AI Behavior Design)

The assistant is guided to:

* Maintain a professional and helpful tone aligned with medical service standards
* Respond accurately and clearly, based only on provided website information
* Stay within scope by only discussing topics relevant to the clinic’s services
* Handle off-topic questions with example-based responses such as:

> “I’m here to help with questions about our eye care services. If you need help with something else, our front desk staff will be happy to assist you.”

---

### Safety & Reliability

To ensure trustworthy and appropriate behavior, the chatbot:

* Uses **Front Range Eye Physicians’ official website** as the source for all content
* Was tested by multiple users to refine clarity, tone, and scope
* Includes **topic guardrails** to limit responses to verified service areas

---

### Tech Stack

* **Platform:** [ChatbotBuilder.ai](https://chatbotbuilder.ai)
* **Deployment Mode:** In-simulator (not publicly deployed)
* **No coding required**, but structured with clear AI behavior instructions and human testing

### Future Improvements

None planned at this time.
This project served as a **learning prototype** and proof of concept; Front Range Eye Physicians works with a highly trained human reception team and will most likely not integrate chatbot automation any time soon.
